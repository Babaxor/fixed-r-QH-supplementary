- **GAP Version:** 4.14.0
- **Semigroups Package Version:** 5.5.4

## Notes

- All scripts are located in the `src/` folder and results are saved in the `results/` folder.
- Verification was performed for semigroups S1 and S2 as detailed in Section 6 of the manuscript.
- Any modifications to scripts or parameters should be logged here.
